# IRRS_Interactive_Restaurant_Reservation_System-

This project is a Java-based simulation of a restaurant reservation system, designed for a Data Structures and Algorithms class. It allows users to book tables, cancel reservations, and view reservation statuses without persistent storage, utilizing in-memory data structures to manage operations and state. Key features include:

- **Reservation Management:** Book tables, cancel reservations, and view reservations with various filters.
- **Table Availability:** Check table availability for specific dates and times.
- **Reservation Summaries:** Generate text-based summaries for specified dates or ranges.

The system operates via a command-line interface with commands such as `book_table`, `cancel_reservation`, `view_reservations`, `check_availability`, and `generate_summary`.
